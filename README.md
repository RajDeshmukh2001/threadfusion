Project Name: ThreadFusion
- - - -

### Overview ###
_ThreadFusion_ is a dynamic and responsive forum website designed and implemented as the final project for CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It provides a platform for users to engage in discussions, ask questions, and explore topics of interest through a well-organized tagging system.
_ThreadFusion_ stands out through its meticulously organized project structure. Django powers the backend, while the frontend leverages JavaScript for dynamic content rendering and templating with HTML and SASS/CSS.

### Distinctiveness ###
* __User Interaction__: The forum provides a dynamic and interactive user experience. Users can not only ask questions but also actively participate in discussions, fostering a sense of community.

* __RichText Editor__: ThreadFusion incorporates the QuillField WYSIWYG editor, enhancing the user experience when composing questions and answers. This feature provides users with a _What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)_ editing experience, allowing them to format text effortlessly. QuillField includes features such as rich text formatting, image and video embedding, adding hyperlinks, changing text color or background, aligning the text, inserting code snippets, and a user-friendly interface, making the process of creating and editing content more intuitive and enjoyable for users.

* __Tagging System__: The implementation of a tagging system adds a layer of organization, allowing users to explore content based on their interests. This feature enhances the user experience and distinguishes ThreadFusion from standard forum platforms.

* __Toast Messages and Deletion Confirmation Popup__: The use of toast messages for success and error notifications enhances user feedback. Additionally, the deletion confirmation popup ensures that critical actions, such as deleting questions and answers, are intentional.

### Complexity ###
The complexity of the project is evident in the implementation of features such as user authentication, dynamic content rendering, and the management of questions and answers. Additionally, the tagging system and search functionality contribute to the project's depth and sophistication.
